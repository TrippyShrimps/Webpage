            <h2>Skyjumping</h2>
            <p>A little third person platforming game made for my Level Design classes at the Jagiellonian University (Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science at the Jagiellonian University). The level design and architecture was done by me. Assets were pulled from the Unity Store and Sketchfab. Scripts were coded in by starowicz727 (github.com/starowicz727).</p>
            <p>Below you can watch the gameplay. The game consists of branching paths, dynamic foliage, as well as light sources. I wanted the game to be in a low-poly style, yet feel more akin to a bigger game with higher graphical fidelity. This was achieved by appropriate lighting and dense foliage. Mechanically, the game has easy to master, simple controls. The challenge lies in the platforming - the key was for the experience to be engaging, but not boring, nor frustrating.</p>

            <h2>Eye tracking study</h2>
            <p>With this eye tracking study I wanted to see if there exists a correlation between the truthfulness of what is perceived in images/common sense and between what is read. The hardware and software were both Tobii Pro Lab branded, kindly given by the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science at the Jagiellonian University. Participants set in front of a laptop with the eye tracker calibrated. Next, they had slides either text, or both images and text.</p>
            <p>Conclusions: people fixated their eyes on details, which were mentioned by the text (e.g. the “red dress”) or fixated on that, which may be untrue or in fact is untrue (e.g. there is no place like “łuk Słowackiego” in Kraków). </p>
            <p>Some of the slides with heatmaps are shown below…</p>

            <h2>UX study</h2>
            <p>This was a quick study for my User Experience course to see how users feel about using VR during a vehicle review and configuration compared to conventional UIs, like a desktop webapp. The car model was pulled from a video game mod website. The project was inspired by the fact, that there is potential for new alternative ways to view cars for customers at home or at smaller showrooms scattered across cities.</p>
            <p>Conclusions: while VR is a promising alternative, as users found the experience immersive and realistic, the same users noted that details like materials, their texture and smell, as well as driving dynamics are hard to simulate or even impossible to simulate with current technology.</p>
            <p>Below you can read the full report, as well as see the VR environment the participants of the study were placed in...</p>

            <p>A survey inspired by the ever growing amount of touch interfaces in cars. The survey asked the participants about how they feel about personal assistants as an alternative to physical- and touch controls. </p>
            <p>Ironically, not long after my findings, Euro NCAP announced that critical controls need to be physical in cars for them to pass with a high safety score.</p>
